The below questions should be answered regarding your submission!

##### Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
> I wish...


##### Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
> Too many. > 10


##### On a scale of 1 (too easy) to 10 (too challenging), how difficult was this assignment? #####
> 7


##### Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
> What most comes to mind is the issue with ".gitignore" not showing up in bash but being present in windows explorer. This was circumvented by using the -a option for "ls" or "dir" [ls -a / dir -a]. Second, what's the purpose of teaching the PATH environment variable at this point when it's not used in this assignment? I was confused as to what I was supposed to display [echo $PATH] because it did not seem relevant to the assignment. This overwhelms the learner who is already bogged down trying to learn new concepts which are necessary for the assignment, and the introduction of a deep concept such as environment variables and processes, etc turns into an unnecessary time and energy drain as the student tries to understand how this fits into the development process, especially when the knowledge is not applied.
